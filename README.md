 A project on android and name is "Basic Tools App" made by me in my industrial training in NETCAMP solu. Pvt. Ltd.   
 In this project I create many classes through google firebase and some normal classes. 
 Firebase helps in signin or rigestering the user with the help of google signin, Email signin and with OTP 
 and normal classes are daily life mobile tools like bluetooth, wifi, torch camera, media player, RealTime Database etc.
